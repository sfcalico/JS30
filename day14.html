    const person = {

    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};
    // console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
